What makes YAML usually more attractive as a config file format over JSON is that those alternative syntaxes are meant to make the structure more human-readable than JSON (by representing lists a bit like bullet points, etc), while JSON is meant to be more machine-oriented.

The fact that it also allows adding comments, unlike JSON1, and that quotes around strings are optional2, also helps make your YAML config files easier to read and write for a human.
