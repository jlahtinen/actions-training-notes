# Before the training
Do we have any pre-emails that we send out to the participants? If so, we should add the following information to it:
- Have a public GitHub account.
- Hands on exercises will be done in the browser, so no need to install anything.
- have a webcam and microphone when joining the class.

In 2/4 courses, people had troubles using their corporate accounts, so they needed to create a new account for the training.


Things to consider:

I know you want to showcase as many capabilities of your product as possible, but you should consider the following:
- Have more hands on exercises to enhance the learning experience (As it is now, it is mostly slides (aprox 4 hours), demo (1 hour), and then hands on (1 hour))

I would recommend another hands-on after workflow commands on day 1, where they add an env in the workflow, create a job with a container as the runtime, maybe with an if expression.

- Workflow commands slides shows 2 tightly packed slides with no demo and no hands on. I would suggest to move the information over to a webpage linked from the slides and then have a demo with one of the commands instead.


There are a very varying levels of engagement in the classes. And none of them have webcams turned on, which lowers engagement even more. Are we telling people to have a webcam and microphone when they join the class?


Why show that you can execute containers directly with the ´uses´ but not show (and have hands on with) the fact that you can user ´container´ to run your steps in a container?

pull_request workflow run what branch is it running on?

Second round: not that many questions making the training last 2.5 hours instead of 3.
Sloooow down in the explanaitions!
